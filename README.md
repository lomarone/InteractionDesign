## Using GitHub
### Creating a new repository

Have a project ready for uploading onto GitHub with it's own directory name that is the **same** as the one for GitHub

Log into your GitHub account

Create a new repository with the **same directory name**. Make sure your source code and README.md file is in the directory.

Go to the Terminal window (Mac) and type in:

	"cd "
(don't forget the extra space), cd = change directory Linux command

to verify and see your files, type in
	
	ls


ls = list files and directories


Drag you folder onto the terminal window and type in the following, which you can cop


	git init
	git add README.md
	git commit -m "first commit"
	git remote add origin https://github.com/scottkildall/InteractionDesign.git
	git push -u origin master
